## üìñ Introduction

Allay is a third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written from scratch, with the goal of being
reliable, fast and feature-rich.

## üéØ Why Allay?

- **Fast**: Allay is very fast. Compared to almost all other server software, Allay is far more performant in almost all aspects. The written from
scratch codebase allows us to re-examine performance critical points and solve problems in the most efficient way.
- **Reliable**: Allay is designed to be reliable. To achieve this goal, we have written a lot of unit tests to ensure the stability of the project.
- **Hassle-free**: Allay is designed to be user-friendly and is ready to use right out of the box. We also have complete documentation to guide you 
in your deployment. 
- **Developer-friendly**: Our api is seperated from the implementation and is well-documented. No more wasting time looking at the implementation.
- **Feature-rich**: One of our goal is to be feature-rich. Thanks to the architecture of Allay, adding new features is very easy for us.
- **Cross-platform**: Benefit from JVM, allay can run on almost any platform.
- **Multi-version**: Allay has multi-version support. No longer worry about losing your players due to version updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Allay is written and running in java 21, so you need to install java 21. There are
several version of java, and we recommend you to use [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) for the best performance.
[OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is also a good choice if you want to have a stable experience.

After you have installed java 21, there are two ways to install Allay:

### ‚ö° Use AllayLauncher

[AllayLauncher](https://github.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher) is the launcher for allay. It has some cool features such as auto-updating, daemon mode
and java checker. To use it, just run the following command based on your OS:

Linux:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher/refs/heads/main/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher/refs/heads/main/scripts/install_windows.ps1").Content
```

### üî® Install Allay Manually

If you platform does not support AllayLauncher, don't be worry! You can also install Allay manually. Just
download the `allay-server-*-shaded.jar` file from our release page. Move it to the folder you want and run:

```shell
java -jar allay-server-*-shaded.jar
```

## üåü Plugins

Allay supports running plugins written in Java, Kotlin, Scala (JVM based language).

### Use Plugin Template

The quickest way to create a new plugin is to use our plugin template!
You can check out the following plugin templates:

- [JavaPluginTemplate](https://github.com/AllayMC/JavaPluginTemplate)
- [KotlinPluginTemplate](https://github.com/MineBuilders/allaymc-kotlin-plugin-template)
- [ScalaPluginTemplate](https://github.com/AllayMC/ScalaPluginTemplate)

### Use Allay in Existing Project

Allay API is published to the Maven Central. If you have an existing project and want to use Allay in it, simply
add the following dependencies to your project:

```kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly(group = "org.allaymc.allay", name = "api", version = "<version>")
}
```

You can also use the snapshot version that is under development. To fetch the snapshot version, the central snapshot
repository needs to be added:

```kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // Add the central snapshot repository
    maven("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
}

dependencies {
    // Add `-SNAPSHOT` suffix to the version to use the snapshot version, an example is `0.12.0-SNAPSHOT`
    compileOnly(group = "org.allaymc.allay", name = "api", version = "<version>-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
