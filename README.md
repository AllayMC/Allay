## Introduction

[//]: # (Allay is the cutest software in the world!)

Allay is a third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in Java with the goal of maintaining high scalability while maintaining high performance through a well-designed architecture. 
For more information, check out our [Q&A](QA.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this project is still at a very early stage and has not yet been released officially, and a large number of interfaces may be added or removed without notice. Please do not use Allay in a production environment.
>
> You can check our roadmap for development progress.

## Features

- **Cross-platform**: Allay is based on JVM, so it can run on most platforms that can run JVM.
- **High Performance**: Allay is based on JVM, so it can run on most platforms that can run JVM.
    - We fully understand the problems of Nukkit server under high load, Allay outperforms Nukkit in certain aspects (eg: entity physics) by a factor of 100 under the same load.
    - In addition, thanks to a redesigned threading model, Allay takes full advantage of multicore CPUs, which means you don't need to intentionally use high CPU frequencies.
    - Allay is based on the latest Java21, which theoretically gives it better performance.
- **Starter-friendly**
    - You can write plugins for Allay in Java/JVM.
    - We introduced GraalVM and JavaScript support, which means you can write plugins in JavaScript/TypeScript and
      get the same performance as Java and the ability to interoperate seamlessly.
- **Large amount of new features** Unlike the Nukkit server, Allay uses a large number of new protocol features that have been introduced by BDS, including but not limited to the server-side authority item bar, and sub-block packetization.
- **Code Quality** We pay a lot of attention to code quality and keep the project stable with the help of extensive unit testing and refactoring.

## Getting Started

Allay is based on Java21, so you need to install Java21 before running & building Allay.
If you need to develop scripting plugins, we recommend using GraalVM for best performance.

**Run directly:**
```shell
gradlew Allay-Server:runShadow
```

**Build:**
```shell
gradlew Allay-Server:build
```

## Plugins

Allay supports running plugins written in Java/JVM or JavaScript languages, you can check out the example plugins to see how to get started:

**Java example**: [Allay-ExamplePlugin](Allay-ExamplePlugin)

**JavaScript example**: [@Allay-ExamplePlugin-JS](@Allay-ExamplePlugin-JS)
