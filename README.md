## üìñ Introduction

Allay is a third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written from scratch, with the goal of being
reliable, fast and feature-rich.

## üéØ Why Allay?

- **Fast**: Allay is very fast. Compared to almost all other server software, Allay is far more performant in almost all aspects. The written from
scratch codebase allows us to re-examine performance critical points and solve problems in the most efficient way.
- **Reliable**: Allay is designed to be reliable. To achieve this goal, we have written a lot of unit tests to ensure the stability of the project.
- **Hassle-free**: Allay is designed to be user-friendly and is ready to use right out of the box. We also have complete documentation to guide you 
in your deployment. 
- **Developer-friendly**: Our api is seperated from the implementation and is well-documented. No more wasting time looking at the implementation.
- **Feature-rich**: One of our goal is to be feature-rich. Thanks to the architecture of Allay, adding new features is very easy for us.
- **Cross-platform**: Benefit from JVM, allay can run on almost any platform.
- **Multi-version**: Allay has multi-version support. No longer worry about losing your players due to version updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Allay is written and running in java 21, so you need to install java 21. There are
several version of java, and we recommend you to use [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) for the best performance.
[OpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) is also a good choice if you want to have a stable experience.

After you have installed java 21, there are two ways to install Allay:

### ‚ö° Use AllayLauncher

[AllayLauncher](https://github.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher) is the launcher for allay. It has some cool features such as auto-updating, daemon mode
and java checker. To use it, just run the following command based on your OS:

Linux:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher/refs/heads/main/scripts/install_linux.sh | bash
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllayMC/AllayLauncher/refs/heads/main/scripts/install_windows.ps1").Content
```

### üî® Install Allay Manually

If you platform does not support AllayLauncher, don't be worry! You can also install Allay manually. Just
download the `allay-server-*-shaded.jar` file from our release page. Move it to the folder you want and run:

```shell
java -jar allay-server-*-shaded.jar
```

## üåü Plugins

Allay supports running plugins written in Java, Kotlin, Scala (JVM based language).

### Use Plugin Template

The quickest way to create a new plugin is to use our plugin template!
You can check out the following plugin templates:

- [JavaPluginTemplate](https://github.com/AllayMC/JavaPluginTemplate)
- [ScalaPluginTemplate](https://github.com/AllayMC/ScalaPluginTemplate)
- [KotlinPluginTemplate](https://github.com/MineBuilders/allaymc-kotlin-plugin-template)

### Use Allay in Existing Project

If you have an existing project and want to use Allay in it, you can add the following
dependencies to your project:

```kts
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven("https://www.jitpack.io/")
    maven("https://repo.opencollab.dev/maven-releases/")
    maven("https://repo.opencollab.dev/maven-snapshots/")
    maven("https://storehouse.okaeri.eu/repository/maven-public/")
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly(group = "org.allaymc.allay", name = "api", version = "master-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

Currently, we use jitpack to publish our artifacts. If you want to use a specified version,
you can check the version list in [jitpack](https://jitpack.io/#AllayMC/Allay) and replace
`master-SNAPSHOT` with the version you want.
