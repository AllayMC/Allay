## Introduction

[//]: # (Allay is the cutest software in the world!)

Allay is a third-party server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in Java with the goal of maintaining high scalability while maintaining high performance through a well-designed architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that this project is still at a very early stage and has not yet been released officially, and a large number of interfaces may be added or removed without notice. Please do not use Allay in a production environment.
>
> You can check our roadmap for development progress.

## Features

Allay has many features that make it stand out from other server software, and here are some of them:

- **Cross-platform:** Allay is based on JVM, so it can run on most platforms that can run JVM.
- **High Performance:**
    - We fully understand the problems of Nukkit server under high load, Allay is a hundred times more performant than Nukkit in some aspects (eg: entity physics).
    - Thanks to the redesigned threading model, Allay takes full advantage of multicore CPUs, which means you don't need to intentionally use server that has high CPU frequency.
    - Allay is based on JDK 21, which theoretically gives it better performance.
- **Easy to Get Started:**
    - You can write plugins for Allay in Java, Kotlin, Scala (JVM based language) and script languages such as JavaScript, Python, etc.
    - We introduced GraalVM, which means you can write plugins in many languages and get the same performance as Java and the ability to interoperate seamlessly.
- **Highly Customizable:** Allay offers a large number of interfaces that can be used directly, and you can't do such thing in BDS.
- **Security:**
    - Allay has more checks on client packets than BDS, and theoretically does not have many of the pernicious vulnerabilities that BDS has.
    - Allay has network encryption enabled by default. In addition, Allay has a built-in resource packet encryption function that automatically encrypts resource packets sent to the client, preventing your data from leaking to a certain extent.
- **Lots of New Features:** Unlike the Nukkit server, Allay uses a lot of new protocol features that have been introduced by BDS, such as server-side authoritative inventory, new chunk format, sub-chunk packet sending, etc.
- **High Code Quality:** We pay a lot of attention to code quality and keep the project stable with the help of extensive unit testing and refactoring.

## Getting Started

### For Normal Users

Check the [Installation](https://docs.allaymc.org/getting-started/installation/) page in our docs.

### Run from Source Code

You may want to run Allay from source code and do some debugging, and that's quiet easy:

```shell
gradlew server:runShadow
```

## Plugins

Allay supports running plugins written in Java, Kotlin, Scala (JVM based language) and script languages such as JavaScript, Python, etc. You can check out our plugin templates:
